# train-schedule

[About] This Train Scheduler takes in user input and stores it on Firebase, which allows viewers to see the schedule in real time. Moment.js uses the data retrieved from Firebase and converts the data stored to times relative to the viewer so no matter who is looking at the schedule, they are able to see the time of the next train and how many minutes away it is from that moment.
